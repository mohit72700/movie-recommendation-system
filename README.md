# movie-recommendation-system
##  1. Software requirement 
*      Jupyter Notebook 
*      Pycharm 
##  2. Implementation process of the project
<p> First i downloaded the datasets required for this project from kaggal. I have given files of both the datasets in my repository. I made one folder on desktop and open it in the jupyter notebook. and past both datasets in that folder. and create a new notebook on jupyter notebook and wrote all the code related to this project. I have given that code in my repository so you can download. I used content based recommendation system in this project. At the end of the code on jupyter notebook i imported pickle library and wrote some lines of code for creating some required pickle files. after running this code it will automatically create three pickle file(movie_list.pkl, movie_dict.pkl, similarity.pkl) on existing folder. You don't need to download pickle files from this repository because it will be automatically create after running the code. Now you have to open pycharm and create an project in virtual environment. Now copy all the pickle files from that folder and past in the project on pycharm that you have created. Now make on App.py file on pycharm in this project folder and write the code. I have given App.py file in  my repository. If there is occuring any error for importing the library then u can install that library using "pip install library_name" command.  </p>

## 3. RUN Command for App.py 
<p> "streamlit run App.py". After running this command local server will be open and u will see the result like image which i have given in my repository.</p>

## 4. Other sources requirment 
<p> You will see that there will be requirement of API key in App.py file. For getting API key you will have to create a account on tmdb website and then you will get your API key from there. For fetching the poster u will be required of tmdb website. </p>
